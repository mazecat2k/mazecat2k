## Bits About Myself

Hey there, I'm Abrar, a fresher at UTM and a coding maestro(jk unless...) hailing from the vibrant land of Bangladesh! My heart beats to the rhythm of turning wild ideas into reality, crafting sleek interfaces that make you go "wow." When it comes to what I create, I'm all about the perfect blend of user experience, rock-solid architecture, and code so clean it practically sparkles. My coding experiences are pretty slim (for now, I am working on it.)

### My Interets

But wait, there's more! I'm not just a code virtuoso; I'm also a die-hard fan of all things open source. I've soaked up a ton of knowledge from the open-source community, and I'm all about that collaborative, knowledge-sharing dance that happens in the open-source world. Let's keep the code love alive! ðŸ’»âœ¨

### My Current Learning Path

The languages I am trying to master right now include: C++, SQL
