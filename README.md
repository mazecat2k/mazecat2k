### **My Interests**                                                                                                                          

Beyond my proficiency in coding, I am a dedicated adherent to the principles of open source. My profound appreciation for collaborative efforts and knowledge-sharing within the open-source community has been integral to my intellectual enrichment. Engaging in the intricate dance of collaborative development, I actively contribute to and draw insights from the expansive realm of open source projects. Let us sustain the spirit of mutual learning and foster the perpetual love for code innovation. ðŸ’»âœ¨

### **My Current skills and learning path**

The languages I am trying to master right now include: C++, SQL, Python, HTML
Apart from that, I am trying my best to get familiarized with the problem solving scene that is really crucial in the field of software engineering. I would say, I am good at finding alternate ways to solve a particular problem.
Currently I am taking courses related to HTML and CSS titled Responsive Web Design by [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)


### **Languages And Tools I Am Passionate To Work With**

I have cultivated a versatile skill set, trying my best to be proficient in a range of languages and tools. I have set my interests in learning Blender for 3D modeling and animation, while my interest for C++ is due to its high-performance computing capability and game development potential.I am also trying to learn HTML to craft immersive web experiences, and Linux for robust server architectures.

Matlab is also in my list of interests for numerical computing, data analysis, and visualization, and I am trying to learn database complexities with Oracle. Althogh Photoshop is my hobby, I use it as a canvas for graphic design, and my interest in Python is because it can serve as a programming Swiss army knife, from web development to artificial intelligence.

In game development, I am trying to familiarize myself with Unity for harmonizing 2D and 3D worlds and Unreal Engine for its advanced graphics. This toolkit represents my dedication to mastering the essentials, as I strive to carve my path in the tech landscape.
